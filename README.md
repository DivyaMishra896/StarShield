 ***StarShield AI – Coordinated Micro-Swarm Detection Engine***

Core Concept:
StarShield detects low-volume, distributed, star-topology coordinated bot networks that evade traditional spike-based detection systems.

The system identifies coordinated influence operations using:

Graph topology analysis (centrality, micro-clusters, star formation)

Behavioral similarity detection (posting intervals, time activity patterns)

Semantic similarity analysis (Sentence-BERT embeddings + cosine similarity)

Risk fusion scoring model

We are NOT limiting the domain to crisis detection. Crisis is only a demo example. The system is broad-domain and enterprise scalable.
